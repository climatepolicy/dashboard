							California's cap and trade system kicked off in 2013 with the overarching goal of returning emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. The program starts with the electric and industrial sectors, and includes transportation fuels starting in 2015.  The cap works by setting the maximum total emissions for regulated sectors (it increases in 2015 with the inclusion of the transportation sector), and allowing facilities to trade so the cheapest reductions take place.  Regulated entities can also meet their obligations by buying offsets, which guarantee emissions reductions elsewhere.  For more on how cap and trade works, check <a href="http://www.c2es.org/docUploads/Cap&Trade.pdf">this</a> out.
						</p>
						<p>
							This graphic shows projected business-as-usual emissions through 2020.  Capped sectors are colored in red, and the overlaid black line indicates the cap for that year.  Note that permits not used in a given year can be saved for a future year ("banked"), but permits for future years cannot be "borrowed" to meet current obligations.  Mouse over a sector to see how permits are allocated.
