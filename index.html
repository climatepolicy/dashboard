			<h2>CAP AND TRADE</h2>
				<p>
					California's <a href = "http://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/capandtrade/capandtrade.htm">Cap and Trade Program</a> caps greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from key sectors in California as a central component of the Assembly Bill 32 (AB32) framework to return California emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. 
				</p>
				<p>	
					The California Cap and Trade Program is designed to achieve the cheapest emissions reductions across the capped sectors. The Program sets maximum, combined greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for all covered sectors each year (the “cap”), and allows covered entities to trade GHG <span title="An allowance is a tradable permit that allows the emission of one metric ton of CO2e." style="color:blue">allowances</span> (permits). The California carbon price is driven by allowance trading. 
				</p>
				<p>	
					The Cap and Trade Program is expected to drive 3.7% of the targeted greenhouse gas reductions by 2020, while complementary carbon policies will achieve the rest. For general information on how cap and trade systems work, check <a href = "http://www.c2es.org/docUploads/climate101-captrade.pdf">this</a> out.
				</p>	
				<p>
					The Cap and Trade Program <a href = "http://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/capandtrade/guidance/chapter2.pdf">covers</a> the power and industrial sectors starting in 2013 and will expand to cover transportation fuels in 2015. The California Air Resources Board (<a href = "http://www.arb.ca.gov">auctions</a> allowances to covered entities. Electric utilities and some industrial emitters receive <a href = "http://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/capandtrade/allowanceallocation/allowanceallocation.htm">CARB</a>) <a href = "http://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/capandtrade/auction/auction.htm">auctions</a> allowances to covered entities. Electric utilities and some industrial emitters receive <a href = "http://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/capandtrade/allowanceallocation/allowanceallocation.htm">freely allocated</a> allowances. Free allocation decreases over time. Regulated entities can also meet 8% of their obligations by buying <a href = "http://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/capandtrade/offsets/offsets.htm#protocols">CARB-approved offsets</a> — emissions reductions from uncapped sectors.
