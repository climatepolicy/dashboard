					<h2>CAP AND TRADE</h2>
					<p>					
						California's cap and trade system kicked off in 2013 with the overarching goal of returning emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. The program starts with the electric and industrial sectors, and includes transportation fuels starting in 2015.  The cap works by setting the maximum total emissions for regulated sectors (it increases in 2015 with the inclusion of the transportation sector), and allowing facilities to trade so the cheapest reductions take place.  Regulated entities can also meet their obligations by buying offsets, which guarantee emissions reductions elsewhere.  For more on how cap and trade works, check <a href="http://www.c2es.org/docUploads/Cap&Trade.pdf">this</a> out.
					</p>
					<p>
						This graphic shows projected business-as-usual emissions through 2020.  Capped sectors are colored in red, and the overlaid black line indicates the cap for that year.  Note that permits not used in a given year can be saved for a future year ("banked"), but permits for future years cannot be "borrowed" to meet current obligations.  Mouse over a sector to see how permits are allocated.
					</p>
					
					<script type="text/javascript">
						var allocation = ["", 
							"<b>Electricity</b> sector permits are allocated freely to insulate electricity customers from sudden price increases.", 
							"<b>Industrial</b> permits are allocated freely until 2015 for all sectors.  After that, allocation is partially free, depending on leakage risk, as shown on page J-23 http://www.arb.ca.gov/regact/2010/capandtrade10/capv4appj.pdf",  
							"<b>Transportation</b> permits are never freely allocated &#8212; the legislature is currently discussing how to use revenues from these auctions for the public benefit.",
							"<b>Commercial and Residential</b> emissions are uncapped, but complementary policies apply (see below).",
							"<b>Recycling and Waste</b> emissions are uncapped, but complementary policies apply (see below).", 
							"<b>High Global Warming Potential</b> emissions are uncapped, but complementary policies apply (see below).", 
							"<b>Agriculture</b> emissions are uncapped, but complementary policies apply (see below).", 
							"<b>Forestry</b> emissions are uncapped, but complementary policies apply (see below)."

					<h2>COMPLEMENTARY POLICIES</h2>
					<p>
						California's cap and trade system is a backstop &#8212; a number of other important policies are in place to achieve the bulk of required emissions reductions.  This graphic shows 2020 business-as-usual greenhouse gas emissions, the contributions of complementary policies, and the 2020 cap. Mouse over for overviews of the policies for each sector.
					</p>
					<script type="text/javascript">
						var othernames = ["", 
							"The <b>Electricity</b> sector is subject to a renewable portfolio standard and renewable energy standard, which together require 33% of emissions be from renewable sources by 2020.  Currently, small scale distributed generation doesn't count toward this goal, but the governor's Million Solar Roofs program ensures progress is made in distributed generation as well.", 
							"The <b>Industrial</b> sector is required to conduct energy efficiency audits and share the results with the Air Resources Board.",  
							"The <b>Transportation</b> sector is affected by a number of policies, including the Pavley Standards, which require significant increases in vehicle fuel efficiency.  Further, the Low Carbon Fuel Standard requires refiners and blenders to source a significant portion of their fuel from renewable sources.",
							"<b>Commercial and Residential</b> energy efficiency programs are expected to yield nearly 12 MMTCO2e in carbon emissions reductions.",
							"<b>Recycling and Waste</b> is a low-emitting sector, but reduction programs are planned nonetheless.", 
							"<b>High Global Warming Potential</b> gases are a significant source of emissions today, but policies are designed to nearly eliminate those emissions by 2020.", 
							"<b>Agriculture</b> emissions aren't addressed by the cap or complementary policies, but offsets protocols may apply.", 
							"Current <b>Forestry</b> sector emissions are almost nonexistent, but new programs are designed to make them a significant net carbon sink by 2020."

					<h2>EMISSIONS HISTORY</h2>
					<p>
						For decades, emissions in California have come primarily from the transportation, electric, and industrial sectors.  Mouse over to see sector names.
