			<h2>CAP AND TRADE</h2>
				<p>
					California's Cap and Trade Program caps greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from key sectors in California as a central component of the Assembly Bill 32 (AB32) framework to return California emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. 
				</p>
				<p>	
					The California Cap and Trade Program is designed to achieve the cheapest emissions reductions across the capped sectors. It sets maximum, combined greenhouse gas emissions for all covered sectors each year (the “cap”), and allows covered entities to trade allowances (GHG permits). The California carbon price is a result of this trading. 
				</p>
				<p>	
					The Cap and Trade Program is expected to drive [X%] of the targeted greenhouse gas reductions by 2020, while complementary carbon policies will achieve the rest. For more information on how cap and trade systems work, check this out.
				</p>	
				<p>
					The Cap and Trade Program covers the power and industrial sector starting in 2013 and will expand to cover transportation fuels in 2015. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) auctions allowances to covered entities. Electric utilities and some industrial emitters receive freely allocated allowances; free allocation decreases over time. Regulated entities can also meet 8% of their obligations by buying CARB-approved offsets — emissions reductions from uncapped sectors.
