			    	<h1>CAP AND TRADE</h1>
					<p>
						California&rsquo;s <a href = "http://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/capanh3rade/capanh3rade.htm">Cap and Trade Program</a> caps greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from key sectors in California as a central component of the Assembly Bill 32 (AB32) framework to return California emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. 
					</p>
					<p>	
						The California Cap and Trade Program is designed to achieve cost-effective emissions reductions across the capped sectors. The Program sets maximum, statewide greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for all covered sectors each year (the &ldquo;cap&rdquo;), and allows covered entities to sell off <span class = "tooltip" title="An allowance is a tradable permit that allows the emission of one metric ton of CO2e." style="color:blue">allowances</span> (permits) that they do not need (the &ldquo;trade&rdquo;). The California carbon price is driven by allowance trading. 
					</p>
					<p>	
						The Cap and Trade Program is expected to drive 3.7% of the targeted greenhouse gas reductions by 2020, while complementary carbon policies will achieve the rest. For general information on how cap and trade systems work, check out this <a href = "http://www.c2es.org/docUploads/climate101-captrade.pdf">C2ES primer on cap and trade for more general information</a>.
